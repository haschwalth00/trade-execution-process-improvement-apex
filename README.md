## Objective

To reduce trade execution time and error rates by automating key operational steps, thereby enabling Apex Global Investments to improve competitiveness, reduce risk, and better capture time-sensitive market opportunities.

## Identified Issues

- **Manual Workflow Bottlenecks:**
  - Data Entry (~15 minutes)
  - Cross-System Validation (~20 minutes)
  - Compliance Approval (~25 minutes)
  - Report Generation (~30 minutes)

- **Cumulative Impact:**
  - Total average execution time: 90 minutes
  - Error rate: 12%

## Proposed Solutions

- **Automation of repetitive tasks** using tools such as UiPath or Power Automate
- **Streamlined compliance approvals** using pre-programmed logic and triggers
- **Automated report generation** to reduce cycle time and human error

## Implementation Plan

1. **Define Goals:** Cut execution time by 50%, reduce errors by 75%
2. **Plan Resources:** Identify automation tools, allocate IT and project management support
3. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Train analysts and compliance staff, conduct kickoff
4. **Pilot Testing:** Apply automation to 20% of trade volume and monitor results
5. **Ongoing Review:** Track KPIs (execution time, error rate, trade capture rate)

## Expected Outcomes

- **Time Reduction:** Execution cycle cut from 90 to ~35 minutes
- **Error Reduction:** Drop from 12% to <3%
- **Higher Trade Opportunity Capture:** Faster turnaround enables time-sensitive decisions
- **Improved Client Experience:** Faster, more reliable execution service
